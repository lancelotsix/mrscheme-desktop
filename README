This package provides the (desktop (MrScheme)) application.
MrScheme is a light IDE used to program and run scheme programs.

MrScheme-desktop develops a light gtk+ wrapper around the original
MrScheme web application. The main interest of using this interface
is the ability to load and save file from and to local filesystems
without sand boxing limitations imposed by browsers.

Building
========

If your obtained those sources via SCM, you need make sure that
all the submodules are present. To do so, you need to run :
  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule updte

This will populate the MrScheme directory needed for proper bundeling.

You will also need to generate standard configure script. To do so, run
  $ autoreconf --install

After those steps or if you received the sources via a tarball, you can simply
run the following command sequence to build the project :
  $ ./configure
  $ make

Installing
==========

After the project have been successfully built, run the following :
  $ make install

Depending on how you configured the project, you might need super-user
privileges to install it.
