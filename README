This package provides the (desktop (MrScheme)) application.
MrScheme is a light IDE used to program and run scheme programs.

MrScheme-desktop develops a light gtk+ wrapper around the original
MrScheme web application. The main interest of using this interface
is the ability to load and save file from and to local filesystems
without sandboxing limitations imposed by browsers.

To regenerate the make file, use "autoreconf -i", then you can use
regular "./configure" "make" and "make install" process.
